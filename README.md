# Telling-Tales-Dataset-Seminar---GenAICS-
This repository contains the dataset prepared for the seminar paper "Gender Bias, AI and Computer Science" at TU Darmstadt. The stories and judgment were generated using Gemini 3 and then human-LLM agreement on the judgment was done. 

This is done for the paper called "Telling Tales to Boys vs. Girls: Analyzing Listener-Dependent Gender Bias in LLM-Generated Children’s Stories".
